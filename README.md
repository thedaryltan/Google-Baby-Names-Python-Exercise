# Google Baby Names Python Exercise
 to document my work on the Google Python Developer Class Exercise for Baby Names Web Page Parser

This python coding exercise is taken from https://developers.google.com/edu/python/exercises/baby-names. Click the link to see the original full text of the exercise.

## Problem Statement:
We have many files that contain lists of the most popular baby names for boys and girls in a particular year.
We would like to have a python script that can run in the command line that helps us parse and organize the data in these HTML files.

## Functionality / Features
### Basic Features
The script must be able to read the files in a directory.
The script will be able to organize the data into a dictionary.
The script can print data to console.

Suggested Milestones:
1. Extract all the text from the file and print it
2. Find and extract the year and print it
3. Extract the names and rank numbers and print them
4. Get the names data into a dict and print it
5. Build the [year, 'name rank', ... ] list and print it
6. Fix main() to use the ExtractNames list

### Advanced Features
The script should have some way to get user input through the command-line interface.
The script should be able to take multiple files as input
The script should be able to write to file.
Implement a --summary flag feature when running the script that when provided together with filepaths, will read the files and generate a summary file
